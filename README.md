# A GUESSING GAME BUILT WITH Js

### ABOUT PROJECT
this project is technically my first attempt at a solo JavaScript project. while using **Colt Steele's** webdev Bootcamp course, i got the the section where you will have to code along a guessing game. i decided to pause and try it out on my own. I was able to come with a functional version of the came on my own. then i went ahead and played the video and finally adapted he's code to mine.

### HOW IT WORKS
- The user is asked to input a number, this number will act as a range.
- the game will only accept a number as valid input.
- then the user will be asked to start their first guess.
- if the number the user entered is too low or to high, then it will prompt the user to try again with a lower or high number until the correct number is guessed.
- then it will output the number of guesses it to the user to guess the right number and the number itself to the console
- there is also a functionality to quit the game using the 'q' key.
